## 📖 About the Project

This project is a Python-based AI Voice Assistant that can recognize user voice commands and respond intelligently. It is capable of performing tasks such as fetching information, opening applications, providing weather updates, and more through real-time speech interaction.  
The assistant features a **user-friendly interface** built with **tkinter**, allowing easy interaction both via **voice** and **click-based commands**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition:** Understands and processes spoken commands.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Replies back using natural voice output.
- 💻 **Graphical User Interface:** Simple and interactive front-end using `tkinter`.
- 🔎 **Information Retrieval:** Fetches real-time data like news, weather, and more.
- 🛠️ **Extensible Design:** Easy to add new functionalities and commands.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **SpeechRecognition** (for recognizing speech input)
- **pyttsx3** (for text-to-speech conversion)
- **Other Python libraries** (like `requests`, `datetime`, etc.)
